# sawCopleyController

This SAW package contains a component (mtsCopleyController) that interfaces to a Copley Controller via a serial (RS232) interface.

The component is designed to be generic, and is configured using a JSON file.

Most of the source code is in the [core](./core) subdirectory to facilitate building with ROS1 or ROS2.
